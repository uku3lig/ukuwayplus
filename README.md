## About
**ukuway+** is a QoL mod for the Minecraft server [Hideaway](https://playhideaway.com/). It adds a variety of features 
to make your experience on Hideaway more enjoyable!

Initially a fork of [Voxxin's HideawayContinued](https://github.com/Voxxin/HideawayContinued), I ended up rewriting the 
entire mod to make the code less buggy, cleaner and more maintainable. Feel free to open a PR if you think otherwise :)

## Features
- Automatically dump inventory items into shops to sell!
- Highlights items in your inventory with their rarity color!
- **Icons** for your friends in usernames!
- **Discord Rich Presence** which shows how cool you are!
- Fully customizeable **config & keybinds**!
- Jukebox feature to play Hideaway original tracks
- Shows the XP percentage above your hotbar
- Adds keybinds for friends list, luggage, wardrobe, profile, mail, palm plate, & journal
- Adds a setting to disable cosmetics
- Adds a setting to disable ambient sounds & activity songs
- teawie.

### Fixes
- Shows your skin in your wardrobe instead of a Steve variant
- Hides your backpack when in first person -- no more seeing it out of the corner of your eye!
- Hides capes on players who are wearing a backpack.
