## About
**ukuway+** is a QoL mod for the Minecraft server [Hideaway](https://playhideaway.com/). It adds a variety of features 
to make your experience on Hideaway more enjoyable!

Initially a fork of [Voxxin's HideawayContinued](https://github.com/Voxxin/HideawayContinued), I ended up rewriting the 
entire mod to make the code less buggy, cleaner and more maintainable. Feel free to open a PR if you think otherwise :)

Assets by [SympathyTea](https://github.com/SympathyTea), [sakecode](https://github.com/sakecode) and [me](https://github.com/uku3lig).
